## 🤖 About Us

Kudo Labs is an open space and community for anyone interested and enthusiastic about learning Machine Learning (ML). We are a group of learners, experimenters, and hobbyists exploring the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) together.

We believe the best way to learn is by doing. Here you'll find various projects, experiments, and learning notes, from the simplest to (hopefully) more complex ones.

Our goal is simple: Learn, build projects, and have fun with data!

## 🧠 Our Interests & Focus

We are learning and experimenting across several areas, including:

* 🤖 **Classical Machine Learning:** From Linear Regression to SVM and Random Forests.
* 🧠 **Deep Learning:** Experimenting with Neural Networks.
* 👁️ **Computer Vision:** Like our [sign-language](https://github.com/kudo-labs/sign-language) project!
* 🔡 **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Trying to understand and process language.
* 📊 **Data Science & Analysis:** Analyzing and visualizing data.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

Main technologies we use (or are learning):

* 🐍 **Python**
* 📓 **Jupyter Notebooks**
* 🔥 **TensorFlow / Keras**
* 🤖 **PyTorch**
* 🧪 **Scikit-learn**
* 🐼 **Pandas & NumPy**

## 🤝 Contributing

We’re open to anyone who wants to learn together. Since we’re also "random" and learning, don’t be afraid to contribute.

If you have ideas, want to fix a bug, or just want to join a project, please:

1. Create an **Issue** for ideas or questions.
2. Fork the repository and send a **Pull Request (PR)**.

No contribution is too small. Welcome to Kudo Labs!
